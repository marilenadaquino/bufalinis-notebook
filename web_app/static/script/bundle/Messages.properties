intro_title1 = Paolo Bufalini and the notebook
p_1 = Paolo Bufalini (Rome, 1915-2001), Italian politician and partisan, was one of the protagonists of post-WWII politics in Italy. Graduated in law, he held leading positions in the Italian Communist Party (PCI) besides being a member of the Parliament and of the Senate of the Republic uninterruptedly from 1963 to 1992. Alongside politics, Bufalini cultivated his interest in classics, and especially Latin literature. His translations of Horace&#39s odes are particularly appreciated &#40<span class="italic">A Leuconoe</span>, Vanni Scheiwiller, 1982 and 1993&#41.
p_2 = Between 1981 and 1991, Bufalini kept a private notebook which he titled <span class="italic">Appunti 1981–1991</span> (transl. <span class="italic">Notes 1981–1991</span>). The contents of the notebook are linked to significant moments of Paolo Bufalini&#39s intellectual and social life: excerpts from literary works, personal notes and comments, narrations of events, unpublished translations from Latin into Italian. Given the private nature of the notebook, the relationships between the various textual components (text-text, text-comment, text-translation, translation-translation) are not explicitly declared. The same applies to the sources of the cited texts.
p_3 = After Bufalini&#39s death, the notebook was donated to the Department of Classic Philology and Italian Studies of the University of Bologna, where a team of scholars transcribed it and identified the sources of the 196 cited texts which include works by Dante, Manzoni, Petrarch, Alfieri, Belli, Campana, Campanella, Carducci, Croce, Passavanti, Pontano, Ripamonti, Tasso (Italian literature)&#59 Catullus, Lucretius, Martial, Horace, Seneca, Tacitus, Virgil, Cicero, Ennius, Juvenal, Justinian, Naevius, Pliny the Younger, Quintilian, Suetonius (Latin literature)&#59 Flaubert, Hegel, Mann, Shakespeare, Tolstoj, Toqueville, Yourcenar (other European literatures).
intro_title_note = Philological note
note_1 = The manuscript, called <em>Appunti 1981-1991</em> by the author, includes quotations from literary texts, comments, notes on historical events, and translations from latin to italian. Since the journal is witten for personal purposes, explicit citations, inter/intra textual relations between excerpts, as well as the names of quoted authors, are not recorded.
note_2 = Scholars of the <em>Centro Studi per la Permanenza del Classico</em>, Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies of the University of Bologna, transcribed the journal and identified 196 sources of citations, belonging to Italian literature (sucha s Dante, Manzoni, Petrarca, Alfieri, Belli, Campana, Campanella, Carducci, Croce, Passavanti, Pontano, Ripamonti, Tasso), latin literature (e.g. Catullo, Lucrezio, Marziale, Orazio, Seneca, Tacito, Virgilio Cicerone, Ennio, Giovenale, Giustiniano, Nevio, Plinio il Giovane, Quintiliano, Svetonio) and European literature (Flaubert, Hegel, Mann, Shakespeare, Tolstoj, Toqueville, Yourcenar). The analysis resulted in the reconstruction of a sophisticated network of links between excerpts. Paolo Bufalini's comments and translations are now linked to the origial sources, also available in the journal.
note_3 = The transcription philologically reproduce the original text. However, in the digital edition we did not reproduce the exact symbols and signs used by the author to separate or graphically connect excerpts. Nonetheless, along with the transcription, the edition offers an interactive visualization of facsimiles, so that the reader can retrieve all the details.
note_4 = Every excerpt is reconciled to the cited work, the latter identified via VIAF and Worldcat identifiers. Unfortunately, we were not able to identify the edition of all the cited works. We adopt LRM (prior FRBR) to decribe the level of information we were able to collect, namely: work, expression, manifestation, and item. The expression includes information about the text (content, translations), while, when applicable, the level manifestation includes information about the edition of the cited work. The figital Edition, the Index of Works and the Index of People always show bibliographic references and person names in the language chosen by the author, regardless the language selected by the user in the menu.


intro_title2 = The Semantic Scholarly Digital Edition of Paolo Bufalini&#39s Notebook
p_4 = The semantic digital scholarly edition of Paolo Bufalini&#39s notebook is a project of the Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies (<a href="https://ficlit.unibo.it/it" target="_blank" alt="Link to FICLIT website">FICLIT</a>) and of the Digital Humanities Advanced Research Centre (<a href="https://centri.unibo.it/dharc/en" target="_blank" alt="Link to /DH.arc website">/DH.arc</a>) of the University of Bologna.
p_5 = The primary aims of the edition are to identify, analyse and enhance the complex network of texts (quotes, comments, translations, narrations, etc.) characterizing the notebook.
intro_title21 = XML/TEI Encoding
p_6 = The XML/TEI model developed for Paolo Bufalini&#39s notebook aims to represent the relationships between the textual fragments of the notebook (citations, comments, translations, etc.) and to link the local authority files to external datasets. The main types of encoded relationships are:
li_1 = Relationships between a quoted text and translations by various authors or by Bufalini himself&#59
li_2 = Relationships between multiple occurrences of the same work in the notebook&#59
li_3 = Relationship between texts juxtaposed by Bufalini for affinity of form and/or content&#59
li_4 = Relationships between intellectuals, whose thought Bufalini comments upon&#59
li_5 = Relationships between cited texts and sources&#59
li_6 = Links to authority files and/or external knowledge bases, such as <a href="http://viaf.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to VIAF website">VIAF</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to DBpedia website">DBpedia</a> and <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to WorldCat website">Worldcat</a>.
intro_title3= The Semantic Edition
p_7 = In order to represent and enhance the complex network of relationships among the texts and the authors of the notebook, the research team decided to produce a digital scholarly edition that exploits Semantic Web technologies. The result is an edition based entirely on linked open data which:
li_7 = uses persistent URIs to identify resources and the relationships between them (through the provider <a href="https://w3id.org" target="_blank">https://w3id.org</a>)&#59
li_8 = uses existing ontologies for the organization of information (in particular <a href="https://sparontologies.github.io/" target="_blank" alt="Link to SPAR Ontologies website">SPAR Ontologies</a>, <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Dublin Core website">Dublin Core</a>, <a href="http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Open Annotation website">Open Annotation</a>, <a href="http://hico.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" alt="Link to HiCO website">HiCO</a>, and <a href="http://nanopub.org/wordpress/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Nanopublications website">Nanopublications</a>)&#59
li_9 = serves data through content negotiation and makes them searchable through a SPARQL endpoint equipped with a graphical interface.
p_8 = The code of the Web application is open source and is available on github. Both data and the code can be reused under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/" class="link" target="_blank">CC-0</a> license.

intro_title31 = The Metamodel
p_9 = The digital scholarly edition of Paolo Bufalini&#39s notebook features two interpretative layers: the author, who juxtaposed texts and highlighted mutual influences, and the editors, who have analysed and formalized Bufalini&#39s choices. In order to distinguish the different layers and associate each RDF statement with its provenance, we employed named graphs and, in particular:
li_10 = RDF statements concerning the entities of the text, such as comments, mentioned people, cited texts, bibliographic references, are part of a single graph (URI: <a href="https://w3id.org/bufalinis-notebook/edition/" target="_blank" alt="Link to the Notebook edition URI">https://w3id.org/bufalinis-notebook/edition/</a>)&#59
li_11 = RDF statements expressing interpersonal relationships and relationships between cited works are stored in separate graphs.
p_10 = Nanopublications allow for the representation of linked open data along with their provenance and publication details. Each set of RDF statements (e.g. representing an author&#39s influence over another) is accompanied by three additional graphs: one containing information about the provenance of the assertions (e.g. Bufalini who notices an influence of one author over another and cites supporting texts)&#59 another containing information about the digital scholarly edition&#59 and a third graph describing the nanopublication itself and linking together the four graphs. The model adopted make it possible to cite each single RDF statement separately from the edition, but in such a way that there is no loss of context. Furthermore, an integrity key is associated to the nanopublications so allow for references to a particular version of the edition through time.
p_11 = The example below shows a nanopublication (serialized in Trig) expressing that a passage of Lucretius&#39 <span class="italic">De Rerum Natura</span> influenced a passage of Alessandro Manzoni&#39s <span class="italic">Inni Sacri</span>.
intro_title32 = The Knowledge Graph of the Edition
p_12 = The main graph includes about 8K triples representing textual phenomena and bibliographic information. The edition reuses the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/" target="_blank" alt="Link to w3.org/annotation-model website">Web Annotation</a> data model to represent texts (quotes, translations, comments)&#59 selected properties from Dublin Core and from the <a href="https://sparontologies.github.io/frbr/current/frbr.html" target="_blank" alt="Link to OWLDL of FRBR website">OWL2DL version of FRBR</a> provided by the SPAR Ontologies are used to link cited texts, cited entities (e.g. people), and other related fragments which precedes, follow, complete or translate the texts. The same ontologies are used also for bibliographic information. The relations between the cited texts and the citing entities (i.e. the texts of the notebook) are formalized through <a href="https://sparontologies.github.io/cito/current/cito.html" target="_blank" alt="Link to CiTO website">CiTO</a>. The following examples, in N3, show an excerpt of the notebook citing lines from <span class="italic">Il Nome di Maria</span> by Manzoni and the full reference to the cited work:
# snippet
intro_title33 = The knowledge graphs of interpretations
p_13 = Bufalini&#39s ideas on the relations among the texts and the authors of the notebook constitute 10% (about 800 RDF triples) of the knowledge base. In order to represent such ideas, we employed HiCO, an ontology extending <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/" target="_blank" alt="Link to PROV-O website">PROV-O</a> with the possibility of specifying a source for the statement, the criteria adopted for formulating the statement, and the type of statement as shown in the example below:
# snippet
p_14 = Bufalini illustrates a relation between two texts by highlighting the common features (e.g. a term or a concept appearing in both texts), whereas when claiming an influence of an author over another, he cites secondary sources in support. To formalize authoritativeness (i.e. the sources, either primary or secondary, on which a claim is based or which support the claim), CiTO is employed.

# specifications overview
overview_1 = <span class="italic">Paolo Bufalini&#39;s notebook</span> Scholarly Semantic Digital Edition (SSDE) project is based on the notebook of handwritten notes by Paolo Bufalini, member of the Italian Communist Party, latinist and translator.
overview_2 = Between 1981 and 1991, Bufalini kept a private notebook which he titled <span class="italic">Appunti 1981–1991</span> (transl. <span class="italic">Notes 1981–1991</span>). The contents of the notebook reflect Bufalini&#39;s intellectual and social life: excerpts from literary works, personal notes and comments, narrations of events, unpublished translations from Latin into Italian. Given the private nature of the notebook, the relationships between the various textual components (text-text, text-comment, text-translation, translation-translation) are not explicitly declared. The same applies to the sources of the cited texts. Due to its complexity in terms of conceptualisation, Paolo Bufalini’s notebook has been chosen as a starting point on which to elaborate a non-linear reading.
overview_3 = The project resulted in a Semantic Scholarly Digital Edition (SSDE) web application which aims to provide tools to access, browse, visualise, study and preserve the notebook and to contextualise it in a semantically-rich and metatextual framework.
overview_4 = The project documentation is organised as follows:
doc_obj = This section introduces the specific objectives underlying the SSDE project.
doc_met = This section explains the methodology used to develop the SSDE web application. Specifically, the development workflow and the reused data models.

# specifications objectives
obj_1 = The objectives are to identify, analyse, formalise and semantically represent the implicit intratextual and intertextual relations that characterise the notebook.
obj_2 = Textual encoding and Semantic Web technologies are integrated, respectively aiming at visualising the logical structure of the document and extracting semantic information from the document.
obj_3 = The result is a knowledge graph where nodes represent the entities of the edition (quotations, comments, translations, authors, works, people, places, etc.) and arcs represent relations between entities.
obj_4 = The edition becomes a network of entities which are uniquely identified by means of persistent URIs.
# specifications methodology
met_1 = We introduce here the XML/TEI P5 markup model, the conversion process from the XML/TEI P5 document into an HTML document, the process of data extraction, and the transformation into RDF according to the specific ontologies.
# specifications markup
mark_up_1 = Markup model
mark_up_2 = <a href="https://github.com/marilenadaquino/bufalinis-notebook/blob/master/web_app/static/bufalini_quaderno.xml" target="_blank" alt="XML/TEI document of the notebook">The text of the notebook is marked up in XML/TEI P5</a>, with a specific focus on a number of entities that are meant to populate the knowledge base.

# specifications markup
person_entity = People
mark_up_3 = In <code>&lt;teiHeader&gt;</code> each personal name is included in a <code>&lt;person&gt;</code> element and uniquely identified by an <code>@xml:id</code>.

doc_web_app_4 = <span class="bold">RDF/XML dataset</span>, named <span class="bold">quaderno_rdf.rdf</span>.
doc_web_app_5 = The development of the SSDE web application requires:

doc_fac = Filters for semantic queries
doc_fac_1 = <span class="bold">Filters</span> are a client-side query tool completely developed in <a href="https://api.jquery.com/" target="_blank" alt="jQuery API documentation">jQuery</a> aimed at analysing the text of the edition from the point of view of its inter and intratextual relationships, as formalised in the SSDE back-end LOD dataset.
doc_fac_2 = <span class="bold">Filters</span> make available a set of checkboxes divided into categories reflecting the actual SSDE dataset organisation and structure. The categories are <span class="bold">People</span>, under which the people mentioned in the notebook are collected; <span class="bold">Person role</span>, through which it is possible to assign a specific role to a mentioned person between <span class="italic">Mentioned person</span> and <span class="italic">Author</span>; <span class="bold">Works</span>, which lists the works cited in the notebook.
doc_fac_3 = Three functions in <span class="bold">notebook.js</span> implement the functionalities of Filters: <span class="bold">editionFilters()</span> for managing the filters in the <span class="italic">Digital Edition</span> section, <span class="bold">peopleIndexFilters()</span> for managing the filters in the <span class="italic">Index of People</span> section, and <span class="bold">worksIndexFilters()</span> for managing the filters in the <span class="italic">Index of Works</span> section.
doc_fac_4 = These are based on the same algorithm adapted to the needs of each section. The basic algorithm works as follows.
# input
fac_input = The algorithm takes as input the category assigned as a <code>@class</code> to each checkbox <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element and its univocal <code>@value</code> to run the functions related to the Filters widget.
fac_input_semantics_1 = In addition, each input filter is assigned with specific attributes to express the semantic relationships between that filter entity and the other entities formalised in the dataset. For instance, each person filter <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> is assigned with the attribute <code>@semantics</code> which reports all the entities having a relation with the entity represented in the filter - directly extracted from the RDF dataset - according to a specific syntax:
fac_input_semantics_2 = <code>person who mentions the input person__fragment of the work in which the citation is present, author#unique code assigned to the fragment in the dataset</code>
fac_input_semantics_3 = The values assigned to specific attributes express the relationships between entites as set in the dataset. They are useful to represent the same relationships at the user interface level.
fac_input_4 = (In case of homonyms, a <code>-i</code> string, where <code>i=0</code> at the beginning of a data extraction cycle, may be added in advance to avoid malfunctioning)
fac_input_5 = An example is reported below where <code>@value="Thomas Mann"</code> and other attributes are assigned to <span class="italic">Thomas Mann</span> entity filter.
# processing
fac_pro = On input change of the given checkboxes, the algorithm searches for specific attributes values assigned to the elements of the reference text in edition/cards in indexes on which the query is performed that matches the input <code>@value</code>.
fac_pro_1 = For instance, in the <span class="italic">Digital Edition</span> section, in the HTML file <span class="bold">quaderno.html</span>, which is uploaded on <span class="bold">index.html</span> by using an AJAX method, and on which the queries are performed, the <span class="italic">Thomas Mann</span> entity is represented as follows.
fac_pro_2 = The checkbox corresponding to <span class="italic">comment</span>, instead, is represented as follows. The attribute value <code>comment</code> is associated with <code>@id</code> in order to assign that specific input value to the input.
fac_pro_3 = By clicking on the checkbox corresponding to <span class="italic">Thomas Mann</span>, the algorithm takes as input the checkbox assigned <code>@value</code> corresponding to <span class="italic">Thomas Mann</span> and searches for it in <code>.tooltiptext</code> values in <span class="bold">quaderno.html</span>. In Digital Edition section, each DOM element containing each <span class="italic">match</span> is assigned with specific attributes which contain the same semantic values of filters <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> to show them in the list of results (<b>getRes()</b> function).
# names of sections
sec_de = <span class="bold">Digital Edition</span>
sec_si = <span class="bold">Semantic Indexes</span>
# output
fac_out = Depending on the web application section, a specific output is returned.
fac_out_1 = In the <span class="italic">Digital Edition</span>, when an input value is matched, a specific CSS class which applies the property <code>background-color</code> is added to the HTML DOM element object which contains the input value occurrence in its attributes or in its content. The attributes assigned to each DOM element are then used to build the results in the list of results.
fac_out_2 = In <span class="italic">Semantic Indexes</span>, when an input value is matched, the matched HTML DOM element object is displayed by using jQuery <code>.show()</code> method. On the contrary, the DOM element objects which are not matched are hidden by using jQuery <code>.hide()</code> method.
# final explanation filters
fac_fin_1 = As explained, the algorithm is completely based on the matching between the attributes values assigned both to the inputs and to the reference corpus HTML DOM elements.
fac_fin_2 = It is worth noting that the <span class="italic">Semantic Indexes</span> Filters engine behaviour is completely different from the <span class="italic">Digital Edition</span> one. In the <span class="italic">Semantic Indexes</span> Filters engine any input value affects the results of any other input value, performing filtering operations on the index. Consequently, every set parameter added in users’ query completely modifies the results obtained from the previous query results. On the contrary, in the <span class="italic">Digital Edition</span> section input values do not affect each other. This implies that the sum of the results of every input are returned, without removal operations.
# data visualisation
datavis_1 = Different tools are used to develop Data Visualization charts:
datavis_2 = All the charts are JavaScript charts based on a JSON data structure. Each required JSON has specific structural features depending on the type of Data Visualisation chart. Since the available data are stored in an RDF/XML data structure, it is fundamental to correctly select the data necessary to the visualisation and convert them from RDF/XML into JSON format.
datavis_3 = To check the required JSON data structure features of each Data Visualisation chart, you are invited to consult the official documentation of each framework reported below:
data_ex = To check Data Visualisation charts in <span class="italic">Paolo Bufalini&#39;s notebook</span> web application, it is possible to check the following web application sections:

# web app home
web_home_1 = We outline here the main system <span class="bold">interface components</span> and <span class="bold">functionalities</span>, starting with the Web application <span class="italic">Homepage</span>.
web_home_2 = <span class="bold">Fig 1. Web application homepage.</span>
web_home_3 = <span class="bold">Fig 2. Guide to use the web application tools.</span>
web_home_4 = <span class="bold">Fig 3. Example of a guide to use modal.</span>
web_home_5 = Il quaderno di Paolo Bufalini</span> Semantic Scholarly Digital Edition (SSDE) web application is very simple in layout (Fig. 1), but at the same time it effectively guides the user to approach the concept of SSDE and to its capabilities (Fig. 2).
web_home_6 = By clicking on a specific tool card, a modal with instructions opens up (Fig 3).
# web app digital edition
web_de_1 = The <span class="italic">Digital Edition</span> section is composed of three panels (Fig. 4), each of which can be opened and closed at users’ request (Fig. 5). Such functionality aims at giving users the possibility to customise their workplace and make it suitable to pursue their own research objectives. Also the transcription itself can be customised by users to make their reading as comfortable and smooth as possible (Fig. 6).
web_de_2 = <span class="bold">Fig 4. Digital Edition section.</span>
web_de_3 = <span class="bold">Fig 5. Digital Edition section layout panels customised.</span>
web_de_4 = <span class="bold">Fig 6. Transcription customisation tools.</span>
web_de_5 = The panels are the following ones.
# web app metadata
web_meta_1 = Metadata
web_meta_2 = By clicking on <span class="italic">Metadata</span> button on the top-right, it is possible to access to the cataloguing metadata of the notebook described (Fig. 7).
web_meta_3 = <span class="bold">Fig 7. Notebook physical object metadata.</span>
# web app page
web_page_1 = Page
web_page_2 = <span class="italic">Page</span> panel is composed of two nested panels: the <span class="italic">Transcription</span> and the <span class="italic">Facsimile</span> panels.
web_page_3 = The <span class="italic">Transcription</span> panel contains the full-text edition of the notebook.
web_page_4 = The <span class="italic">Facsimile</span> panel contains the annotated images. Specifically, the facsimiles annotations highlight the excerpts identified as comments, quotations and translations, also referencing cited works and people, so as to support the reader in comparing the original text and the transcription, and to access detailed information related to the semantics of the text. It is available the IIIF Manifest in the same panel as well.
web_page_5 = In addition, users may access the transcription of the hovered excerpt by clicking on it. So doing, the left transcription panel automatically scrolls to the corresponding point.
web_page_6 = Such system operation is possible since <span class="italic">Transcription</span> and <span class="italic">Facsimile</span> panels are linked together. By clicking on the facsimiles arrow buttons or by using the page selector, the transcription automatically scrolls and shows the corresponding transcription page.
web_page_7 = <span class="bold">Fig 8. Digital Edition interface. Focus on annotated facsimiles.</span>
# web app filters
web_fac_1 = Filters
web_fac_2 = On the left side of the <span class="italic">Digital Edition</span> section, the panel <span class="italic">Filters</span> includes a user-friendly semantic query tool aimed at analysing the edition text from the point of view of its inter and intratextual relationships, as formalised in the linked data dataset underlying the edition (Fig. 9).
web_fac_3 = Filters makes available a set of checkboxes divided into the following categories: <span class="bold">People</span>, all the people mentioned in the notebook; <span class="bold">Person role</span>, through which it is possible to assign a specific role to a mentioned person between  <span class="bold">Mentioned person</span> and  <span class="bold">Author</span> (for instance, <span class="italic">Thomas Mann</span> can be mentioned as an author of an excerpt by Bufalini, or mentioned without a specific role); <span class="bold">Works</span>, which lists the works cited in the notebook.
web_fac_4 = By using <span class="italic">Filters</span>, users perform targeted client-side semantic queries and browse only relevant contents.
web_fac_5 = A query in <span class="italic">Filters</span> returns all the notebook excerpts related to the set query parameters as formalised in the LOD dataset. Specifically, the returned excerpts are highlighted in a specific colour in the transcription text. In addition, all query results are made available in a list appearing above the <span class="italic">Filters</span> tool. Such a list is updated every time users add/remove a query parameter. Each list item corresponding to a result is a link clicking on which the transcription scrolls to the specific result highlighted in the text.
web_fac_6 = Different colours are assigned to <span class="italic">Filters</span> categories, input values, and excerpts highlighted in the transcription.
web_fac_7 = A specific observation on the filters processing is needed. The user has to start her query by selecting only one person. Once the person is selected, the list of results reports all its occurrences in the transcription. After selecting a person, the <b>Role box</b> is unblocked. Each person mentioned in the notebook in fact may have one of two different roles with respect to the text, as formalised in the dataset:  <span class="bold">Author</span>, if the person has written the excerpt, or  <span class="bold">Mentioned person</span>, if the person is only mentioned in the excerpt. To highlight such semantics in the text, the user can set a specific role to the chosen person as input value. By assigning a role, all its occurrences covering the selected role change colour: the blue colour of <span class="bold">Persons</span> category is replaced by the colour of the role input value. On the other hand, all occurrences of the person without the input role are hidden. The choice of a role unblocks the <b>Works</b> box, in which only works related to the selected person covering the specific set role will be shown and selectable.
web_fac_8 = Thus, the implicit semantics of each textual excerpt is made explicit and distinguishable by its background colour on the user-side.
web_fac_9 = <span class="bold">Fig 9. Digital Edition Filters tool.</span>
web_fac_10 = <span class="bold">Fig 10. A query on <span class="italic">Thomas Mann</span> as <span class="bold">Author</span> performed by using <span class="italic">Filters</span> tool and corresponding results.</span>
web_fac_11 = If users set a <span class="bold">Work</span> query parameter, all the excerpts which address the same work are returned along with their provenance and author in the list of results, highlighted with the background colour assigned to the type of excerpt (comment, quotation, translation) in the transcription.
web_fac_12 = Although input values produce autonomous results, their visual structure suggests a precise semantics. The <span class="bold">People</span> and <span class="bold">Types of excerpts</span> categories are the parent categories, while <span class="bold">Person role</span> and <span class="bold">Works</span> are nested children which specify the values of their parent category: users may select a person and then specify with which role; a type of excerpt and then from which work. Selecting a child value without a parent value is allowed as well.
web_fac_13 = For an example, see the query result shown in Fig. 11.
web_fac_14 = <span class="bold">Fig 11. A query on <span class="italic">Thomas Mann</span> as <span class="italic">Author</span> and <span class="italic">La montagna incantata, Thomas Mann</span> performed by using <span class="italic">Filters</span> and corresponding results.</span>
web_fac_15 = The query input values are the following: person <span class="italic">Thomas Mann</span>, role <span class="italic">Author</span> and work <span class="italic">La montagna incantata, Thomas Mann</span>.
web_fac_16 = That is: return <span class="italic">all the quotations of La montagna incantata by Thomas Mann in which Thomas Mann is mentioned as an author</span>.
web_fac_17 = <span class="italic">Thomas Mann</span> appears twice, as an <span class="italic">author</span> (lilac colour) in the results of the list.
web_fac_18 = Each <span class="italic">Thomas Mann</span> is followed by a <span class="italic">quotation</span> excerpt and the name of the person who cites him.
web_fac_19 = If a person is mentioned in a fragment of a work cited in the notebook, information about the specific fragment in which the citation appears is reported, its provenance work, and its author are reported in the results.
web_fac_20 = The aim of <span class="italic">Filters</span> is to highlight semantic information that is implicit in the text and to make it explicit and <span class="italic">visible</span> to the user through the interface.
web_fac_21 = <span class="bold">Fig 12. A query on <span class="italic">Giosuè Carducci</span> and corresponding results.

# specifications semantic indexes
semantic_ind_1 = Semantic Indexes
semantic_ind_2 = The <span class="italic">Index of People</span> and the <span class="italic">Index of Works</span> sections, together with the <span class="italic">Digital Edition</span>, are aimed at leveraging and enhancing the user experience when navigating the LOD dataset.
semantic_ind_3 = Both the indexes are composed of two panels, namely: <span class="bold">Filters</span>, already available in <span class="italic">Digital Edition</span>, and a panel which modifies its title depending on the selected tab item (<span class="bold">List</span>, the only available for now, and the coming soon <span class="bold">Treemap</span>, <span class="bold">Sets</span>, <span class="bold">Graph</span> and <span class="bold">Play with data</span>). Each tab item corresponds to a different way to visualise the data regarding people and works mentioned in the notebook and their relationships.
semantic_ind_4 = <span class="bold">Fig 13. Index of People</span>.
# list mode
list_mode = List mode
list_mode_1 = <span class="italic">List</span> is the most intuitive and easy to use tool to access and comprehend the index. All the people and works mentioned in the notebook are respectively presented in the <span class="italic">Index of People</span> in alphabetical order and in the <span class="italic">Index of Works</span> in citation frequency order.
list_mode_2 = Mentioned people are associated with a link to their <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/" target="_blank" alt="">DBpedia</a>/<a href="http://viaf.org/" target="_blank" alt="VIAF website">VIAF</a> authority record, the person who mentions them in the notebook (according to the scheme <span class="italic">surname, name, and a button for each comment/quotation/translation in which they are mentioned (Fig. 13).
list_mode_3 = Cited works are associated with their author (according to the scheme surname, name, and a button for each comment/quotation/translation regarding them (Fig. 14).
list_mode_4 = Each button is identified by the univocal code assigned to the excerpt in the dataset and inherits the colour of the type of the excerpt used in the <span class="italic">Digital Edition</span> section.
list_mode_5 = <span class="bold">Fig 14. Index of People. Focus on comments and quotations expressed semantics.</span>
list_mode_6 = <span class="bold">Fig 15. Index of Works. Focus on quotations expressed semantics.</span>

list_mode_10 = That is: return <span class="italic">all the occurrences of Thomas Mann as an author or mentioned person</span>.
list_mode_11 = In the list of results are omitted all people not related to <span class="italic">Thomas Mann</span>, and it shows all those who mention him.
list_mode_12 = In summary, the <span class="italic">Index of People</span> filters the results depending on the input parameters.
list_mode_13 = If the combination of inputs does not match each other, the returned results are zero.
list_mode_14 = <span class="bold">Filtering search bar</span>
list_mode_15 = Another available tool in the Indexes is the <span class="italic">filtering search bar</span>, which allows a general keyword search.
list_mode_16 = The system always shows as results the entire index profiles in which the input keyword occurs, and omits the ones which do not contain any keyword occurrence.
# treemap mode
tree_mode_1 = Treemap mode
tree_mode_2 = <span class="italic">Treemap</span> is a Data Visualisation chart which shows entities as nodes within a hierarchy of blocks. Each block corresponds to an entity node and its dimensions and colours are directly proportional to the citation frequency of the entity (Fig. 16, 17).
tree_mode_3 = The hierarchy is composed of two levels of blocks. The highest one contains the parent nodes, while the other their children.

# graph mode
graph_1 = Graph mode
graph_2 = <span class="italic">Graph</span> is a Data Visualisation chart which visualises the entities as nodes linked to each other by arcs. Each node corresponds to an entity which is linked to at least one entity, while each arc corresponds to the relationship between two nodes.
graph_3 = <span class="bold">Fig 24. Index of People Graph.</span>
graph_4 = Nodes size is directly proportional to the citation frequency of the entity.
graph_5 = Each node corresponds to a person who mentions another person when the node dimensions are considerable, and to a person who is mentioned by other people when the node dimensions are smaller. The relationships established in the graph correspond to the relationships between people entities as formalised in the dataset.
graph_6 = By hovering a node, users get the name of the corresponding person entity and the relationships with other nodes. The arcs representing the relationships are highlighted when the node person mentions other people (Fig. 25).
